# NC Editor

There are 2 NC editors in **FalconView**:
- one for the active NC file ![Edit](images/SK_Edit.png), i.e. the job that is to be executed
- an independent one ![TestEdit](images/SK_TestEdit.png), in order to be able to carry out some gcode editing during job processing.

File changes can be saved with **[F10]** or discarded with **[Esc]**.

When switching to the NC editor, the *Open* button is active. **[Space]**
is sufficient to execute the action. For file selection the
[File manager](filemanager) is used.
