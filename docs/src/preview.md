# 3D preview ![Edit](images/SK_Auto.png)

The preview shows the (*expected*) toolpaths of the active NC file.
In the lower area the corresponding NC file is displayed.
When the NC file is executed, the line that is currently being executed is highlighted. The toolpaths in the preview change color, depending on
whether that segment is currently being executed or has already been executed. The colors can be changed in the settings ![Settings](images/SK_Settings.png).

The toolpaths can be viewed from different angles. These keyboard shortcuts are supported to change the view:

- **[Ctrl + T]** - View from top.
- **[Ctrl + R]** - View from right side
- **[Ctrl + L]** - view from the left
- **[Ctrl + F]** - Front view
- **[Ctrl + B]** - View from behind
- **[Ctrl + 3]** - 3D view
- **[F]** without additional key can be used to fit the workpiece into the
window (zoom)
