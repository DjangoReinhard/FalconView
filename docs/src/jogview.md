# Manual operation ![Manual operation](images/SK_Manual.png)

This page is used to move the machine by pressing a button. There are different types of movement:
- At the push of a button, the relevant axis moves by one step (**single step**), whereby the step size is adjustable (top right).
- At the push of a button, the machine moves until **Stop** is pressed.

The movement can take place either at the configured speed for manual operation, or at rapid traverse, i.e. at max. possible speed.

Again, only the buttons for the configured axes of the machine are displayed.

As keyboard shortcut serves the **identifier of the axis**, where the upper case letters stand for
positive direction and the lower case letters for negative direction. So a
small **x** moves the X-axis in negative direction, a capital **X** moves the
X axis in positive direction (capital X means [*Shift* + *x*] ).

Other key combinations:
- **[right/left arrow keys]** - changes the step size for single step mode.
- **[Arrow keys up/down]** - change the speed factor
- **[Alt + S]** - change between single step and continuous mode
- **[Alt + E]** - changes between normal speed and rapid speed mode
