# additional NC editor ![TestEdit](images/SK_TestEdit.png)

The additional NC-Editor serves as a tool, if during a long lasting processing another file is to be edited.
The additional NC editor is not coupled with the automatic processing. A file that is loaded or executed in the main editor cannot be loaded in the additional editor.

If the NC editor is activated, the *Open* button is active. **[Space]**
is sufficient to execute the action. For file selection the
[file manager](filemanager) is used.

Supported key combinations:

- **[Ctrl + S]** saves changed files. The previous file is renamed as a backup.

- **[Ctrl + F]** opens an input dialog to search for a text.

There are 2 NC editors in **FalconView**:
- one for the active NC file ![Edit](images/SK_Edit.png), i.e. the job to be executed
- an independent ![TestEdit](images/SK_TestEdit.png), to be able to make changes to other files even during job processing.
