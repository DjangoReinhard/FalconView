\section1 common start of \b {FalconView} is as display app of \e {linuxCNC}.

          Configuration-file of \e {linuxCNC} has a section \b {[DISPLAY]} with an entry
\list
   \li    Display = <executable>
\endlist
          If \b {FalconView} can be started by using system path, then this entry will be
\list
   \li    Display = FalconView
\endlist
          Starting \b {FalconView} as part of \e {LinuxCNC} will start the application
          like this

          The red button at bottom right signals, that \b {Emergency-Stop} is active.

          You can click the button with the mouse, but as \b {FalconView} has been
          designed to be used without mouse, hit \e {CTRL+ALT+P}.

          If connection with backend is ok, the \e {Powerbutton} should turn yellow.

          That signals, that the machine is turned off, but \b {Emergency-Stop} is not hit.

          Next mouse-click or \e {CTRL+ALT+P} will turn the machine on, which in turn
          changes the color of the \b {Powerbutton} into green.

          In this state you can load a different \e {gcode-file} for execution or
          change some system settings. But no motion is possible yet.

          To enable controlled motion, you need to reference all axis (home each axis).
          That is the button at top right with the four arrows pointing to a dot.
          Shortcut of that button is: \e {CTRL+ALT+H}

          That enables the motion dependant modes. To enable automatic moves (controlled by
          gcode commands) click on the second button of the \l {reference.html#application-mode-4}{application mode toolbar}
          or hit \e {F3}.
